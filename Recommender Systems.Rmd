iHeartRadio is a free broadcast and internet radio platform owned by iHeartMedia, Inc. and was founded in April 2008 as the website iheartmusic.com. As of 2017 iHeartRadio functions as a music recommender system and is the national umbrella brand for iHeartMedia's radio network aggregating its over 850 local iHeartMedia radio stations across the United States, as well as hundreds of other stations from various other media.

##Who are the target users?
iHeart's target users are all age groups who are looking for a customized music experience.



##What are their key goals?
Ultimately key goals would be to provide an experience worth paying  $5 - $10 per month for, depending on service level. There are free live and artist-based radio stations which are recommended based on your genre choices. There is also a free 'MY Favorites Radio' station where you can like and dislike tracks that is a slightly more customized feature.

What is is provided as part of the paid subscription is a more customized, commercial-free music experience similair to Spotify or Pandora.



##How can you help them accomplish those goals?
As of right now the iHeartRadio player has a like/dislike rating tool used on songs playing on live and customized radio stations. Liking or disliking songs for all live stations provides feedback to the station being played. Liking a song on customized stations will have it and songs like it played more often. Disliking a song on customized stations means the song will not be played again. These data are used to personalize users' 'My Favorites Radio' station. As My Favorites Radio learns a user's music taste over time, it adds various bonus tracks into the mix. 

The method seems fairly simplistic and seems like a more compolex machine learning algoritm or neural net could be implemented to understand in better detail a listeners taste, which could result in higher subscription rates.
